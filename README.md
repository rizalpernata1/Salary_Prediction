# Salary_Prediction_Using_LinearRegression

The goal of the prediction is to estimate a person's salary based on their years of work experience. By using a linear regression model, we can make predictions about the potential salary someone may earn based on the number of years of work experience they have. This can be useful in various scenarios, such as determining a fair salary for a new employee or negotiating salary terms.
